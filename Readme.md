# Hackanoho 2025

This repo is part of a workshop for the 2025 Hackanoho at UoA, designed to help students hack being a data scientist using Large Language Models (LLMs). We will see how we can use LLM integrations in a common IDE (integrated development environment) to "fake until we make it!"

## Prerequisites

To participate in this workshop, you'll need to have the following installed:

1. **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** - Visual Studio Code is required for this workshop, as we'll be using its features and extensions extensively for LLM-powered data science workflows. Click on the link to download and install.

2. **[Github Account](https://github.com)** - You'll need a Github account (hopefully created in a previous session) to access and work with this repository. 

3. **[Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/get_started/)** - A package management tool that helps manage dependencies and virtual environments.
    Install instructions vary by OS (Linux, Mac, Windows); the key thing is that all are supported.
